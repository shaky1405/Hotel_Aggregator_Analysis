# Hotel_Aggregator_Analysis
Excited to share that Iâ€™ve just completed my third task at Mentorness! ðŸŽ‰
This time, I delved into hotel aggregator analysis and developed an insightful dashboard using Power BI to visualize the given dataset. ðŸ“Šâœ¨
Here's a glimpse of what I worked on:
Analyzed various metrics such as hotel occupancy rates, pricing trends, and customer reviews.
Created interactive visualizations to highlight key insights and trends in the hotel industry.
Provided actionable insights to help improve strategic decision-making for hotel aggregators.
Iâ€™m proud of how this project turned out and eager to apply these skills to more complex data challenges. A big thank you to the Mentorness team for their continuous support and guidance.
